Sudo is my 3D artwork side of my site.

I've been using Blender on and off for about 10 years but it's really only been
since version 2.5 onwards that I've tried to really get into it.

I really enjoy polygon modelling. I used Rhino for a short period several years ago
and I know that I really enjoyed using its nurbs and bezier approach so I guess
it just happens that I enjoy whatever tool I have in my hands.
