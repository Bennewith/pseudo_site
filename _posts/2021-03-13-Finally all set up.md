Pseudo is my Photography side of my site.

It's taken me 5 months and 4 days to get this all set up and ready to start writing posts.
Actually with Covid shut-downs and immigrating to Scotland all tied in, it's only actually
taken me a week to figure this out. I've dabbled with Ruby for more than a few years on and
off, most of the time trying to figure out Rails at the same time.
I found Sinatra a lot more adaptable to my simple needs Jekyll appears to tick all my boxes.
Free static site hosting on Github pages makes all this a no brainer.
