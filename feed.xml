&lt;p&gt;It’s taken me 5 months and 4 days to get this all set up and ready to start writing posts.
Actually with Covid shut-downs and immigrating to Scotland all tied in, it’s only actually
taken me a week to figure this out. I’ve dabbled with Ruby for more than a few years on and
off, most of the time trying to figure out Rails at the same time.
I found Sinatra a lot more adaptable to my simple needs Jekyll appears to tick all my boxes.
Free static site hosting on Github pages makes all this a no brainer.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Pseudo is my Photography side of my site.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Sudo is 3d art</title><link href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/03/13/Sudo-is-3D-art.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sudo is 3d art" /><published>2021-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-03-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/03/13/Sudo%20is%203D%20art</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2021/03/13/Sudo-is-3D-art.html">&lt;p&gt;Sudo is my 3D artwork side of my site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been using Blender on and off for about 10 years but it’s really only been
since version 2.5 onwards that I’ve tried to really get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy polygon modelling. I used Rhino for a short period several years ago
and I know that I really enjoyed using its nurbs and bezier approach so I guess
it just happens that I enjoy whatever tool I have in my hands.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Sudo is my 3D artwork side of my site.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Getting set up</title><link href="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/09/09/Getting-set-up.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Getting set up" /><published>2020-09-09T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-09-09T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/09/09/Getting%20set%20up</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://127.0.0.1:4000/2020/09/09/Getting-set-up.html">&lt;p&gt;It’s time to set this site up using Jekyll hosted on Github Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
